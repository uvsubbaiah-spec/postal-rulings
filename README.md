# ఈ-పద వినోదం — website and phone app

A phone-first web app for **telugupadavinodam.blogspot.com**. It reads every padavinodam post straight from the blog's feed, turns it into a playable crossword with a Telugu akshara keypad, and works offline after the first visit. It can be installed on Android from Chrome like a normal app.

No server, database or payment card is needed: these are plain static files.

## What's in the folder

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The whole app (layout, styles and code in one file) |
| `puzzles.json` | Extra posts made in the Claude studio (uploads, corrections). Starts empty. |
| `rain.webp` | Animated rain for the black squares (from the blog's GIF, compressed) |
| `sw.js` | Offline support |
| `manifest.webmanifest`, `icon-*.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png` | App name and icons for "Install app" |
| `.nojekyll` | Tells GitHub Pages to serve the files as they are |

## Put it online with GitHub Pages (free, no card)

1. Sign in to github.com and create a new **public** repository, for example `padavinodam`.
2. On the repository page choose **Add file → Upload files**, drag in **every file from this folder** (not the folder itself), and press **Commit changes**.
3. Open **Settings → Pages**. Under *Build and deployment* choose **Deploy from a branch**, branch **main**, folder **/ (root)**, and press **Save**.
4. After a minute or two the site is live at `https://<your-github-name>.github.io/padavinodam/`.

Other no-card options that work the same way: **Netlify Drop** (app.netlify.com/drop — drag the folder in) and **Cloudflare Pages** (upload the folder as a project).

The site must be served over **https** for offline support and installing; all three hosts above do that automatically.

## Install on an Android phone

Open the site in **Chrome** → menu (⋮) → **Install app** (or **Add to Home screen**). It opens full-screen with its own icon, like any other app.

## Typing answers

A bar above the keyboard switches between **తెలుగు** (the in-app Telugu akshara keypad, one akshara per tap) and **ENG** (type the whole word on any phone keyboard), and **దాచు** hides the keyboard to show the whole grid.

In ENG, type the complete answer and press space, Enter or **పెట్టు**: the app splits it into aksharas and puts them in the selected word's squares. A full-length word always starts from the word's first square, wherever the cursor is; a shorter piece goes from the selected square. While you type, the word's squares are shown right above the box (and in the grid, dashed) so you see where each akshara will land, and the board stays visible above the phone keyboard. `kamalam` → కమలం, `sankraanti` → సంక్రాంతి, `amma` → అమ్మ. Capitals give the harder sounds (T ట, D డ, N ణ, L ళ, Sh ష, E ఏ, O ఓ) and `aa`/`ee`/`oo` give long vowels; the app also offers the likely alternatives to tap. A Telugu phone keyboard works in the same box. On a computer, just start typing letters while a puzzle is open.

Answer colours follow the blog: a right letter turns grey with a green border and blue letter, a wrong one gold with a red border and red letter. The selected square has a blue frame.

The magnifier buttons on the puzzle's top bar zoom the grid from 100% to 200% (it then scrolls sideways); pinch-zoom on the phone works too.

## Keeping posts up to date

- **New blog posts appear on their own.** Every time the app opens it reads the blog's feed (the blog must stay public).
- **Posts made in the Claude studio** (from a newspaper photo or PDF, or a corrected blog post) live in `puzzles.json`. In the studio's admin page press **puzzles.json సేవ్ చేయండి**, then upload that file to the repository in place of the old one. A post in `puzzles.json` replaces the blog post with the same date.
- **Correcting a clue's Telugu text:** in the Claude studio, open the puzzle, select the clue and tap the pencil on the clue bar (or use **మార్చు** in the admin list for the full editor). Type the fix in Telugu, or in English and it converts. Save publishes it in the studio at once; export `puzzles.json` as above to update the website. For blog posts, import them into the studio first (admin page → బ్లాగ్ నుంచి దిగుమతి) so there is a copy to correct.

## Putting it on the Play Store (optional)

Go to **pwabuilder.com**, enter your site's address and choose **Package for stores → Android**. It produces:
- an **APK** you can install directly or share with people, with no store and no fee, and
- an **AAB** for the Play Store. Publishing there needs a Google Play developer account, which has a one-time registration fee paid by card.

## Try it on your computer first (optional)

From this folder run `python -m http.server 8000` and open `http://localhost:8000`. Offline support works on localhost too.

## Notes

- Puzzle content comes from the blog; the crosswords themselves are Eenadu's. Check permission before publishing the app widely or on a store.
- Progress, settings and the chosen theme are kept on each phone only.
